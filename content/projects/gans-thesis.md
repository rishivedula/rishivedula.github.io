### Overview
Developed a novel GAN architecture for high-quality image synthesis as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis in Robotics.

### Key Achievements
- Improved model convergence by **35%** using advanced optimization techniques.
- Generated photorealistic images with an FID score of **12.5**, outperforming baseline models.
- Published findings at [Conference Name] (link).

### Technologies Used
- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
